# Parking Lot Design â€“ Factory, Strategy, and Null Object Patterns

## Requirements
- Vehicles enter the parking lot, take a ticket, are assigned the nearest available parking spot, pay at the exit, and leave.
- Support for multiple entrances and exits (currently 1 each, extensible).
- Support for multiple vehicle types (2-wheeler, 4-wheeler, extensible for future types).
- Parking spots are assigned based on vehicle type and proximity (nearest spot, cheapest, etc.) using a strategy.
- Payment can be per entry or per minute (support both, extensible).
- System should handle unsupported vehicle types gracefully (no null pointer exceptions).
- Parking spot management should be extensible for new strategies (e.g., least fees, reserved spots).

## Objects
- **Vehicle**: Represents a vehicle entering the lot.
    - vehicleNo: String
    - vehicleType: enum (2WHEELER, 4WHEELER, ...)
- **Ticket**: Issued at entry.
    - entryTime: DateTime
    - parkingSpot: ParkingSpot
    - vehicle: Vehicle
- **EntranceGate**: Handles entry logic.
    - findParkingSpot(): Uses ParkingSpotManager and ParkingStrategy to assign a spot.
    - updateParkingSpot(): Marks spot as occupied.
    - generateTicket(): Issues a ticket with entry time, vehicle, and spot info.
- **ParkingSpot**: Represents a spot in the lot.
    - id: String
    - isEmpty: boolean
    - vehicle: Vehicle
    - price: double
    - type: enum (2WHEELER, 4WHEELER, ...)
- **ExitGate**: Handles exit logic.
    - calculateCost(): Uses PricingStrategy to compute parking fee based on duration and spot type.
    - processPayment(): Handles payment and marks spot as available.
    - updateParkingSpot(): Marks spot as empty.
- **PricingStrategy**: Interface for different pricing algorithms (e.g., flat rate, hourly, dynamic pricing).
- **PricingStrategyFactory**: Factory for creating appropriate PricingStrategy objects based on rules (e.g., vehicle type, time of day, special events).
- **ParkingSpotManager (Abstract Class)**: Base class for managing parking spots, with concrete managers for each vehicle type (e.g., TwoWheelerSpotManager, FourWheelerSpotManager). Uses a ParkingStrategy. Can also act as a factory for creating and managing parking spots for its vehicle type. Abstract class is used to share common logic and state among all managers.
- **ParkingStrategy**: Interface for different spot assignment strategies (nearest, least fees, etc).
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating Vehicle, ParkingSpot, and PricingStrategy objects.
- **Null Object Pattern**: Used for unsupported vehicle or spot types.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for flexible parking spot assignment logic.

---

## Patterns Used
- **Factory Pattern**: Centralizes creation of vehicles, parking spots, and pricing strategies.
- **Null Object Pattern**: Provides safe fallback for unsupported types.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows dynamic selection of parking spot assignment logic (e.g., nearest, cheapest).
- **ParkingSpotManager as Factory**: Each manager can encapsulate the creation and management of parking spots for its type, acting as a factory for spots.

## Why Not a Factory for ParkingSpotManager?
- In the current design, `ParkingSpotManager` instances (e.g., `TwoWheelerSpotManager`, `FourWheelerSpotManager`) are created directly in the code, not via a factory.
- This is often acceptable when:
    - The number and types of managers are fixed or known at compile time.
    - The construction logic is simple and does not require encapsulation or abstraction.
- **When to use a Factory for ParkingSpotManager:**
    - If you want to centralize and abstract the creation logic for different managers (e.g., based on configuration, vehicle type, or runtime conditions).
    - If you want to make the system more extensible for new manager types without changing client code.
    - If the construction of managers becomes complex (e.g., with dependencies, strategies, or external resources).
- **How to add a Factory:**
    - Create a `ParkingSpotManagerFactory` with a method like `getManager(String type, List<ParkingSpot> spots, ParkingStrategy strategy)` that returns the appropriate manager instance.

**Summary:**
- You can add a factory for `ParkingSpotManager` if you want more flexibility, abstraction, or extensibility.
- For simple or static scenarios, direct instantiation is fine.

---

**Key Takeaways:**
- EntranceGate and ExitGate use managers and strategies for extensible logic.
- PricingStrategyFactory (Factory Pattern) centralizes creation of pricing strategies, making it easy to add or change pricing rules.
- Factory Pattern is used for object creation throughout the design (vehicles, spots, pricing strategies).
- CostComputationFactor can be extended for dynamic pricing, discounts, or special rules.
- Each vehicle type can have its own ParkingSpotManager for specialized logic and extensibility.
- Factory Pattern centralizes object creation and makes the system extensible for new types.
- Null Object Pattern avoids null pointer exceptions and provides safe fallback behavior for unsupported types.
- Strategy Pattern allows dynamic change of parking spot assignment logic.
- ParkingSpotManager can also act as a factory for creating and managing parking spots for its vehicle type.
- This approach keeps the parking lot logic robust, extensible, and easy to maintain.


### doubts 
1. Is ParkingSpotManager (as an abstract class) part of the Factory Pattern?
Yes, it can be!
If ParkingSpotManager is responsible for creating and managing parking spots (e.g., createSpot() or addSpot() methods), then it acts as a factory for parking spots.
In this case, it encapsulates the creation logic for different types of parking spots, which is a key idea of the Factory Pattern.

2. Why use an abstract class instead of an interface for ParkingSpotManager?
Abstract Class:
Allows you to provide shared code (fields like List<ParkingSpot> spots, and common methods like parkVehicle()).
You can define both abstract methods (to be implemented by subclasses) and concrete methods (shared logic).
Useful when you want to avoid code duplication and provide a base implementation.

Interface:
Only defines method signatures (no fields, no shared codeâ€”except static/final fields and default methods in modern Java).
Use when you want to define a contract but donâ€™t need to share code.

Summary:
Use an abstract class when you want to share code and state among all managers.
Use an interface if you only want to define a contract, and each implementation is completely independent.
In your parking lot file, using an abstract class for ParkingSpotManager is appropriate because it allows you to share common logic and state (like the list of spots) among all specific managers (e.g., TwoWheelerSpotManager, FourWheelerSpotManager).
