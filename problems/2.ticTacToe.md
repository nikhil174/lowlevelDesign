# Tic Tac Toe Design â€“ OOP, Extensibility, and Patterns

## Requirements
- A board with n x n cells (default 3x3, extensible to any size)
- Multiple symbols (default: O and X, extensible to more symbols)
- Multiple players (default: 2, extensible to more players)
- Each player is assigned a unique symbol
- Players take turns to place their symbol in an empty cell
- Winning rule:
    - Any row, column, or diagonal filled with the same symbol results in a win for that player
    - If the board is full and no player wins, the game is a draw

## Objects
- **PieceType**: Enum for possible symbols (X, O, ...)
- **Piece**: Represents a symbol placed on the board
    - type: PieceType
- **Board**: Represents the game board
    - size: int
    - board: Piece[][]
    - isCellEmpty(int row, int col): boolean
    - placePiece(int row, int col, Piece piece): boolean
    - checkWin(Piece piece): boolean
    - isFull(): boolean
- **Player**: Represents a player
    - name: String
    - piece: Piece
- **Game**: Controls the game flow
    - players: List<Player>
    - board: Board
    - currentPlayerIndex: int
    - play(): void
    - makeMove(int row, int col): boolean
    - getWinner(): Player
    - isDraw(): boolean

## Extensibility & OOP Points
- Easily add more symbols or players by extending enums and lists
- Board size is configurable (not hardcoded to 3x3)
- Game logic is separated from UI/interaction
- Methods are provided for checking win/draw, making moves, and managing turns

## Patterns Used
- **Enum Pattern**: For symbol types (PieceType)
- **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates its own data and logic
- **Extensibility**: Design allows for easy addition of new features (symbols, players, board size)

## Key Takeaways
- When is Piece useful?
    If you plan to extend the game with more attributes per piece (e.g., color, power-ups, metadata), then a Piece class is justified.
    For simple Tic Tac Toe, using just the PieceType enum is sufficient and more straightforward.
- The design is extensible for more players, symbols, and board sizes
- Each class has a single responsibility and encapsulates its logic
- Enum and OOP patterns make the code robust and easy to maintain
- Game logic is separated from UI, making it suitable for CLI, GUI, or web interfaces
