# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (fields) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

## Example
- **Class**: `Account` with private fields and public methods

```java
class Account {
    private double balance;
    public void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
    public void withdraw(double amount) { if (amount <= balance) balance -= amount; }
    public double getBalance() { return balance; }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Account acc = new Account();
        acc.deposit(500);
        acc.withdraw(200);
        System.out.println(acc.getBalance());
    }
}
```

## Real-World Use Case
- Encapsulation is used in banking (Account), e-commerce (Cart), and any system where you want to protect data integrity.
