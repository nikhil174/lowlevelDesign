# Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

## Example
- **Abstract Class**: `Payment`
- **Concrete Classes**: `CreditCardPayment`, `UPIPayment`

```java
abstract class Payment {
    abstract void pay(double amount);
}

class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
    void pay(double amount) { System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " by credit card"); }
}

class UPIPayment extends Payment {
    void pay(double amount) { System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " by UPI"); }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment payment = new CreditCardPayment();
        payment.pay(100.0);
    }
}
```

## Real-World Use Case
- Payment gateways, database drivers, and device drivers use abstraction to provide a simple interface while hiding complex logic.
