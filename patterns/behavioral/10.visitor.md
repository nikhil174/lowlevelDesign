# Visitor Design Pattern

The Visitor pattern lets you add new operations to existing object structures without modifying their classes. It separates the operation logic from the object structure, making it easy to extend functionality.

## Example: Room Operations

Suppose you have different types of rooms in a hotel, and you want to perform various operations (reservation, maintenance, pricing) on them without changing their classes.

```java
// Element interface
interface RoomElement {
    void accept(RoomVisitor visitor);
}

// Concrete Elements
class SingleRoom implements RoomElement {
    public void accept(RoomVisitor visitor) { visitor.visit(this); }
}
class DoubleRoom implements RoomElement {
    public void accept(RoomVisitor visitor) { visitor.visit(this); }
}
class DeluxeRoom implements RoomElement {
    public void accept(RoomVisitor visitor) { visitor.visit(this); }
}

// Visitor interface
interface RoomVisitor {
    void visit(SingleRoom room);
    void visit(DoubleRoom room);
    void visit(DeluxeRoom room);
}

// Concrete Visitors
class RoomReservationVisitor implements RoomVisitor {
    public void visit(SingleRoom room) {
        System.out.println("Reserving Single Room");
    }
    public void visit(DoubleRoom room) {
        System.out.println("Reserving Double Room");
    }
    public void visit(DeluxeRoom room) {
        System.out.println("Reserving Deluxe Room");
    }
}

class RoomMaintenanceVisitor implements RoomVisitor {
    public void visit(SingleRoom room) {
        System.out.println("Maintaining Single Room");
    }
    public void visit(DoubleRoom room) {
        System.out.println("Maintaining Double Room");
    }
    public void visit(DeluxeRoom room) {
        System.out.println("Maintaining Deluxe Room");
    }
}

class RoomPricingVisitor implements RoomVisitor {
    public void visit(SingleRoom room) {
        System.out.println("Pricing Single Room: $100");
    }
    public void visit(DoubleRoom room) {
        System.out.println("Pricing Double Room: $150");
    }
    public void visit(DeluxeRoom room) {
        System.out.println("Pricing Deluxe Room: $250");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RoomElement[] rooms = { new SingleRoom(), new DoubleRoom(), new DeluxeRoom() };
        RoomVisitor reservation = new RoomReservationVisitor();
        RoomVisitor maintenance = new RoomMaintenanceVisitor();
        RoomVisitor pricing = new RoomPricingVisitor();

        for (RoomElement room : rooms) room.accept(reservation);
        for (RoomElement room : rooms) room.accept(maintenance);
        for (RoomElement room : rooms) room.accept(pricing);
    }
}
```

how is it different from strategy pattern?

## Single Dispatch vs Double Dispatch (using above example)

**Single Dispatch:**
- Method calls are resolved based on the runtime type of the object (the receiver). For example, calling `room.accept(visitor)` will invoke the `accept` method of the actual room type (SingleRoom, DoubleRoom, etc.).

**Double Dispatch (Visitor pattern):**
- The Visitor pattern uses two method calls to resolve both the type of the element and the type of the visitor.
- First, `room.accept(visitor)` is called, which is resolved by the room's runtime type.
- Then, inside `accept`, `visitor.visit(this)` is called, which is resolved by the visitor's runtime type and the room's compile-time type.
- This allows the operation to depend on both the room type and the visitor type, enabling flexible and type-safe operations.

**In the example:**
- `room.accept(reservation)` calls `SingleRoom.accept(RoomReservationVisitor)` â†’ inside, calls `RoomReservationVisitor.visit(SingleRoom)`
- Both the room and visitor types are considered (double dispatch).

## Visitor vs Strategy Pattern

**Visitor Pattern:**
- Used to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying their classes.
- Operations are separated into visitor classes, and elements "accept" visitors.
- Good for scenarios where you need to perform unrelated operations on a fixed set of classes.

**Differences from Strategy Pattern:**
- Visitor is about adding new operations; Strategy is about changing how an operation is performed.
- Visitor uses double dispatch; Strategy uses single dispatch.

## Key Takeaways
- Visitor pattern lets you add new operations to existing object structures without modifying their classes
- Each visitor implements operations for each element type
- Makes it easy to extend functionality and keep code organized
- Uses double dispatch to resolve both element and visitor types
- Different from Strategy, which is for switching algorithms, not adding new operations
