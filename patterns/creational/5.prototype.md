# Prototype Design Pattern

The **Prototype Pattern** is used to create new objects by copying (cloning) existing objects, rather than creating them from scratch. This is useful when object creation is costly or complex, or when you want to duplicate objects with the same or similar state.

## Problem: Cloning Complex Objects
Suppose you have a `Student` class with many variables, some of which are private. If you want to create a new `Student` object with most values the same as an existing one, you might try to copy fields manually. This is error-prone, especially for private fields, and breaks encapsulation.

**Issue:**
- Manual copying is tedious and can miss private fields.
- If the class changes, all copy logic must be updated.
- Deep copy (copying nested objects) is even harder.

## Solution: Prototype Pattern
The Prototype pattern solves this by letting objects clone themselves, typically via a `clone()` method.

```java
// Student.java
public class Student implements Cloneable {
    private String name;
    private int rollNumber;
    private String address;
    private double marks;
    // ... other fields, possibly private

    public Student(String name, int rollNumber, String address, double marks) {
        this.name = name;
        this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
        this.address = address;
        this.marks = marks;
    }

    // Getters and setters
    public double getMarks() {
        return marks;
    }
    public void setMarks(double marks) {
        this.marks = marks;
    }

    @Override
    public Student clone() {
        try {
            return (Student) super.clone(); // shallow copy
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            throw new AssertionError();
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student original = new Student("Alice", 101, "123 Main St", 95.5);
        Student copy = original.clone();
        copy.setMarks(98.0); // Only change what you need
        System.out.println("Original marks: " + original.getMarks()); // 95.5
        System.out.println("Copy marks: " + copy.getMarks());         // 98.0
    }
}
```

## Deep Copy Example
If your object contains references to mutable objects (e.g., a list of subjects), override `clone()` to perform a deep copy:

```java
@Override
public Student clone() {
    try {
        Student cloned = (Student) super.clone();
        cloned.subjects = new ArrayList<>(this.subjects); // deep copy
        return cloned;
    } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways
- Prototype pattern enables object cloning without exposing internal details.
- Reduces code duplication and preserves encapsulation.
- Use for objects that are expensive to create or need to be copied frequently.

**Note:**
- In Java, implement `Cloneable` and override `clone()`.
- For deep copies, clone mutable fields explicitly.
