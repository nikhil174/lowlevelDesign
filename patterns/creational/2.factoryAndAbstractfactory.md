# Factory Pattern
- The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern used to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
- It allows you to create objects based on some condition or input, returning different types of objects that share a common interface.
- This pattern helps in decoupling object creation from its usage, making the code more flexible and maintainable.

**Example Use Case:**
- Suppose you have a `Shape` interface, and concrete classes like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square` that implement this interface.
- To create objects, you use a `ShapeFactory` class that returns the appropriate shape based on input.

```java
// Shape interface
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

// Concrete shapes
class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Circle"); }
}
class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle"); }
}
class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Square"); }
}

// Factory class
class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType == null) return null;
        switch (shapeType.toUpperCase()) {
            case "CIRCLE":
                return new Circle();
            case "RECTANGLE":
                return new Rectangle();
            case "SQUARE":
                return new Square();
            default:
                return null;
        }
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeFactory factory = new ShapeFactory();
        Shape shape1 = factory.getShape("CIRCLE");
        shape1.draw(); // Output: Drawing Circle
        Shape shape2 = factory.getShape("RECTANGLE");
        shape2.draw(); // Output: Drawing Rectangle
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Centralizes object creation logic.
- Makes code more flexible and easier to extend.
- Reduces code duplication and tight coupling.

**When to use:**
- When you have a common interface and multiple concrete implementations.
- When the exact type of object to create can be determined at runtime based on input or configuration.



# Abstract Factory Pattern
- The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- It is essentially a factory of factories: it returns a factory for a group of related products.

**Example Use Case:**
- Suppose you have a `Vehicle` interface, and multiple concrete vehicles (e.g., `LuxuryCar`, `LuxuryBike`, `OrdinaryCar`, `OrdinaryBike`).
- You want to create families of related vehicles (luxury or ordinary) without specifying their concrete classes in client code.

```java
// Product interface
interface Vehicle {
    void average();
}

// Concrete products
class LuxuryCar implements Vehicle {
    public void average() { System.out.println("LuxuryCar average: 15 km/l"); }
}
class LuxuryBike implements Vehicle {
    public void average() { System.out.println("LuxuryBike average: 40 km/l"); }
}
class OrdinaryCar implements Vehicle {
    public void average() { System.out.println("OrdinaryCar average: 20 km/l"); }
}
class OrdinaryBike implements Vehicle {
    public void average() { System.out.println("OrdinaryBike average: 60 km/l"); }
}

// Abstract Factory
interface VehicleFactory {
    Vehicle createCar();
    Vehicle createBike();
}

// Concrete Factories
class LuxuryVehicleFactory implements VehicleFactory {
    public Vehicle createCar() { return new LuxuryCar(); }
    public Vehicle createBike() { return new LuxuryBike(); }
}
class OrdinaryVehicleFactory implements VehicleFactory {
    public Vehicle createCar() { return new OrdinaryCar(); }
    public Vehicle createBike() { return new OrdinaryBike(); }
}

// Factory Provider
class FactoryProvider {
    public static VehicleFactory getFactory(String type) {
        switch (type.toUpperCase()) {
            case "LUXURY":
                return new LuxuryVehicleFactory();
            case "ORDINARY":
                return new OrdinaryVehicleFactory();
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown factory type");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VehicleFactory luxuryFactory = FactoryProvider.getFactory("LUXURY");
        Vehicle luxuryCar = luxuryFactory.createCar();
        luxuryCar.average(); // Output: LuxuryCar average: 15 km/l
        Vehicle luxuryBike = luxuryFactory.createBike();
        luxuryBike.average(); // Output: LuxuryBike average: 40 km/l

        VehicleFactory ordinaryFactory = FactoryProvider.getFactory("ORDINARY");
        Vehicle ordinaryCar = ordinaryFactory.createCar();
        ordinaryCar.average(); // Output: OrdinaryCar average: 20 km/l
        Vehicle ordinaryBike = ordinaryFactory.createBike();
        ordinaryBike.average(); // Output: OrdinaryBike average: 60 km/l
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Groups related product creation together.
- Ensures products from the same family are used together.
- Makes it easy to add new product families without changing client code.
- Promotes consistency among products.

**When to use:**
- When your system needs to create families of related objects.
- When you want to enforce that products from the same family are used together.
- When you want to abstract away the creation logic for a group of related products.
