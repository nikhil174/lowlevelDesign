# Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are generally classified into three main categories:

## 1. Creational Patterns
- Deal with object creation mechanisms.
- Aim to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
- Examples:
  - Singleton
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
  - Prototype

## 2. Structural Patterns
- Deal with object composition and typically help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same.
- Examples:
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy

## 3. Behavioral Patterns
- Deal with object collaboration and responsibility.
- Focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other.
- Examples:
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Interpreter
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Observer
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
  - Visitor
