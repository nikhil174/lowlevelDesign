# Adapter Design Pattern

- The Adapter Pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, allowing them to work together.
- It is commonly used to integrate legacy or third-party code with new systems, or to adapt APIs to client expectations.

## Real-World Examples
- **Power Adapter:** Converts a plug shape (e.g., round to rectangular) so a device can fit into a different socket.
- **API Adapter:** Converts XML data from a server to JSON format for a client expecting JSON.
- **Weight Machine Adapter:** Converts weight from pounds (as provided by a legacy machine) to kilograms (as required by the client).

## Example: Weight Machine Adapter (Java)

Suppose you have a legacy `WeightMachine` that gives weight in pounds, but your client code expects weight in kilograms.

```java
// Existing interface (legacy)
interface WeightMachine {
    double getWeightInPounds();
}

class LegacyWeightMachine implements WeightMachine {
    public double getWeightInPounds() {
        return 180.0; // Example value
    }
}

// Target interface (expected by client)
interface WeightMachineAdapter {
    double getWeightInKg();
}

// Adapter implementation
class WeightMachineAdapterImpl implements WeightMachineAdapter {
    private WeightMachine machine;
    public WeightMachineAdapterImpl(WeightMachine machine) {
        this.machine = machine;
    }
    public double getWeightInKg() {
        return machine.getWeightInPounds() * 0.453592;
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeightMachine legacy = new LegacyWeightMachine();
        WeightMachineAdapter adapter = new WeightMachineAdapterImpl(legacy);
        System.out.println("Weight in kg: " + adapter.getWeightInKg());
    }
}
```

## Industry Use Cases
- Integrating third-party payment gateways with your e-commerce platform.
- Adapting different logging frameworks to a common interface.
- Connecting new microservices to legacy systems with incompatible data formats.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Adapter Pattern enables code reuse and system integration without modifying existing code.
- It is ideal for bridging gaps between old and new systems, or between incompatible APIs.
