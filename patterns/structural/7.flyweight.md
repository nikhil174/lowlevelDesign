# Flyweight Design Pattern

The **Flyweight Pattern** helps reduce memory usage by sharing common data between multiple objects. It is especially useful when you need to create a large number of similar objects that share expensive or heavy data.

## Problem Example
Suppose you have a `Robot` class with coordinates (`x`, `y`), a `type` string, and a heavy `Sprite` object. If you create 500,000 humanoid robots and 500,000 robotic dogs, each with its own `Sprite`, memory usage becomes enormous (e.g., 31GB for 1 million robots).

```java
// Without Flyweight
class Sprite {
    // Heavy object, e.g., image data (30KB)
}
class Robot {
    private int x, y;
    private String type;
    private Sprite sprite;
    public Robot(int x, int y, String type, Sprite sprite) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.type = type;
        this.sprite = sprite;
    }
}

// In main
for (int i = 0; i < 500_000; i++) {
    new Robot(i, i, "humanoid", new Sprite());
    new Robot(i, i, "robotic_dog", new Sprite());
}
// Memory usage is huge!
```

## Solution: Flyweight Pattern (with Interface and Factory)

**Intrinsic Data:** The state that is shared and stored inside the flyweight object. This data is independent of the flyweight's context and is common to many objects (e.g., robot type, sprite/body).  
**Extrinsic Data:** The state that is unique to each object and is supplied by the client at runtime. This data depends on the context in which the flyweight is used (e.g., coordinates x, y).

**Steps:**
1. Move all intrinsic (shared) data into the flyweight object.
2. Make the flyweight class immutable.
3. Pass extrinsic (context-specific) data as method parameters when using the flyweight.
4. Use a factory to manage and cache flyweight objects.

```java
// Flyweight interface
interface IRobot {
    void display(int x, int y);
}

// Concrete flyweights
class HumanoidRobot implements IRobot {
    private final String type = "humanoid";
    private final Sprite body; // heavy sprite/body data
    public HumanoidRobot(Sprite body) {
        this.body = body;
    }
    public String getType() { return type; }
    public Sprite getBody() { return body; }
    @Override
    public void display(int x, int y) {
        System.out.println("Displaying " + type + " at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with sprite: " + body);
    }
}
class RoboticDog implements IRobot {
    private final String type = "robotic_dog";
    private final Sprite body;
    public RoboticDog(Sprite body) {
        this.body = body;
    }
    public String getType() { return type; }
    public Sprite getBody() { return body; }
    @Override
    public void display(int x, int y) {
        System.out.println("Displaying " + type + " at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with sprite: " + body);
    }
}

// Sprite class
class Sprite {
    // Heavy object, e.g., image data (30KB)
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "[SPRITE_DATA]";
    }
}

// Flyweight Factory
import java.util.*;
class RobotFactory {
    private static final Map<String, IRobot> cache = new HashMap<>();
    public static IRobot createRobot(String type) {
        if (!cache.containsKey(type)) {
            if (type.equals("humanoid")) {
                cache.put(type, new HumanoidRobot(new Sprite()));
            } else if (type.equals("robotic_dog")) {
                cache.put(type, new RoboticDog(new Sprite()));
            }
        }
        return cache.get(type);
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 500_000; i++) {
            IRobot humanoid = RobotFactory.createRobot("humanoid");
            humanoid.display(i, i);
            IRobot dog = RobotFactory.createRobot("robotic_dog");
            dog.display(i, i);
        }
        // Only 2 robot objects are created and shared!
    }
}
```

**Q: If the same flyweight object is used, will only one object be displayed with the last (x, y) values?**

**A:** No. The flyweight object (e.g., `HumanoidRobot`) is shared, but the extrinsic data (x, y) is passed as a parameter to the `display` method each time. Each call to `display(x, y)` uses the current values of x and y, so the output will reflect the correct coordinates for each call. The flyweight object does not store or remember the last (x, y) valuesâ€”it only uses them for that specific method call. This is what allows a single shared object to represent many logical objects with different context-specific data.

## Example 2: Word Processor (Flyweight)
A classic real-world use of the Flyweight pattern is in word processors. Each character (glyph) on the screen is represented by a flyweight object that stores intrinsic data (the character code, font, style), while extrinsic data (position, formatting context) is supplied at runtime. This allows millions of characters to be displayed using only a small set of shared flyweight objects.

```java
// Flyweight for character glyphs
interface Glyph {
    void display(int x, int y, String color);
}
class CharacterGlyph implements Glyph {
    private final char character; // intrinsic
    private final String font;    // intrinsic
    public CharacterGlyph(char character, String font) {
        this.character = character;
        this.font = font;
    }
    @Override
    public void display(int x, int y, String color) { // extrinsic
        System.out.println("Displaying '" + character + "' in font " + font + " at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with color " + color);
    }
}
// Factory for glyphs
import java.util.*;
class GlyphFactory {
    private static final Map<String, Glyph> cache = new HashMap<>();
    public static Glyph getGlyph(char character, String font) {
        String key = character + font;
        cache.putIfAbsent(key, new CharacterGlyph(character, font));
        return cache.get(key);
    }
}
// Usage
public class WordProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Glyph aArial = GlyphFactory.getGlyph('a', "Arial");
        Glyph bArial = GlyphFactory.getGlyph('b', "Arial");
        aArial.display(10, 20, "black");
        bArial.display(20, 20, "red");
        // Only one object per unique (character, font) pair is created and shared!
    }
}
```

## When to Use Flyweight
- When memory usage is critical.
- When many objects share common, heavy data.
- When object creation is expensive.

## Key Takeaways
- Flyweight pattern reduces memory footprint by sharing intrinsic (common) state.
- Use a factory to manage and share flyweight objects.
- Ideal for large-scale systems with many similar objects (e.g., game characters, icons, trees in a forest, etc.).
