# Bridge Design Pattern

The **Bridge Pattern** decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This is useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation, and when both can change or extend separately.

## Problem: Tightly Coupled Inheritance
Suppose you have a `LivingThing` class with an abstract method `breatheProcess()`. Subclasses like `Dog`, `Fish`, and `Tree` each implement their own breathing process. However, this approach is tightly coupledâ€”adding a new breathing process or a new type of living thing requires creating new subclasses for every combination.

```java
// Tightly coupled example
abstract class LivingThing {
    abstract void breatheProcess();
}
class Dog extends LivingThing {
    void breatheProcess() { System.out.println("Dog breathes through lungs (land)"); }
}
class Fish extends LivingThing {
    void breatheProcess() { System.out.println("Fish breathes through gills (water)"); }
}
class Tree extends LivingThing {
    void breatheProcess() { System.out.println("Tree breathes through leaves (air)"); }
}
```

## Solution: Bridge Pattern
With the Bridge pattern, we separate the breathing process (implementation) from the living thing (abstraction).

```java
// Implementer
interface BreatheImplementer {
    void breathe();
}
class LandBreathe implements BreatheImplementer {
    public void breathe() { System.out.println("Breathing on land (lungs)"); }
}
class WaterBreathe implements BreatheImplementer {
    public void breathe() { System.out.println("Breathing in water (gills)"); }
}
class TreeBreathe implements BreatheImplementer {
    public void breathe() { System.out.println("Breathing through leaves (photosynthesis)"); }
}

// Abstraction
abstract class LivingThing {
    protected BreatheImplementer breatheImplementer;
    public LivingThing(BreatheImplementer breatheImplementer) {
        this.breatheImplementer = breatheImplementer;
    }
    public abstract void breatheProcess();
}

// Refined Abstractions
class Dog extends LivingThing {
    public Dog(BreatheImplementer breatheImplementer) {
        super(breatheImplementer);
    }
    public void breatheProcess() {
        System.out.print("Dog: ");
        breatheImplementer.breathe();
    }
}
class Fish extends LivingThing {
    public Fish(BreatheImplementer breatheImplementer) {
        super(breatheImplementer);
    }
    public void breatheProcess() {
        System.out.print("Fish: ");
        breatheImplementer.breathe();
    }
}
class Tree extends LivingThing {
    public Tree(BreatheImplementer breatheImplementer) {
        super(breatheImplementer);
    }
    public void breatheProcess() {
        System.out.print("Tree: ");
        breatheImplementer.breathe();
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LivingThing dog = new Dog(new LandBreathe());
        LivingThing fish = new Fish(new WaterBreathe());
        LivingThing tree = new Tree(new TreeBreathe());

        dog.breatheProcess();   // Dog: Breathing on land (lungs)
        fish.breatheProcess();  // Fish: Breathing in water (gills)
        tree.breatheProcess();  // Tree: Breathing through leaves (photosynthesis)
    }
}
```

## Similarity and Difference with Strategy Pattern

**Similarity:**
- Both Bridge and Strategy patterns use composition to delegate behavior to another class (the implementer/strategy).
- Both promote flexibility and decoupling by allowing behavior to be changed at runtime.
- Both patterns define interfaces for interchangeable behaviors.

**Difference:**
- **Intent:**
  - Bridge is about decoupling abstraction from implementation so both can vary independently (focuses on two orthogonal class hierarchies).
  - Strategy is about selecting an algorithm or behavior at runtime (focuses on encapsulating interchangeable algorithms).
- **Structure:**
  - Bridge typically involves two parallel hierarchies: Abstraction and Implementer.
  - Strategy usually involves a context class and a family of interchangeable strategy classes.
- **Use Case:**
  - Use Bridge when you have multiple dimensions of variation (e.g., types of living things and types of breathing processes).
  - Use Strategy when you want to switch between different algorithms or policies for a single dimension (e.g., different sorting algorithms).

**Summary Table:**
| Aspect      | Bridge Pattern                        | Strategy Pattern                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Purpose     | Decouple abstraction & implementation | Encapsulate interchangeable behavior  |
| Structure   | Two class hierarchies                | Context + strategy interface/classes  |
| Use Case    | Multiple dimensions of variation      | Switch algorithms at runtime          |
| Example     | LivingThing & BreatheImplementer      | PaymentContext & PaymentStrategy      |

## Key Takeaways
- Bridge pattern enables independent extension of abstraction and implementation hierarchies.
- Reduces class explosion when you have multiple dimensions of variation.
- Promotes composition over inheritance.

**Use when:**
- You want to avoid a permanent binding between abstraction and implementation.
- Both abstraction and implementation may change or extend independently.
